## 3.6.0

### Minor Changes

- c01bd5a8b: No external facing APIs for @dopt/javascript have changed. However, in this release, we've rewritten @dopt/javascript to be more reactive and allow access of flows, blocks, and components before the instance has fully initialized. We've fixed a number of bugs with @dopt/javascript specifically around accessing these objects before the instance was initialized. Additionally, we've introduced a number of quality of life improvements with respect to typedocs, README.md, etc. The new release of @dopt/javascript is used internally by @dopt/vue to power our newly released Vue SDK.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c01bd5a8b]
  - @dopt/semantic-data-layer-tour@0.2.0

## 3.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8bd8d1167: Our opensource packages previously produced build artifacts that were intended to to be friendly to various build and module systems by

  1. Using `"type": "commonjs"` in their `package.json` (the default and less modern configuration)
  1. Using file extensions to delineate between module systems (e.g. `mjs` for ESM and `cjs` for CJS)

  This strategy, while seemingly friendly more freindly than using `"type": "module"`, caused issue for older build tools that do not support these file extensions.

  This change moves all of our open source packages and their transitive `"dependencies"` to use `@dopt/pkg-build`, our newly created CLI for building packages in the most backward compatible way we can come up with.

  This strategy shifts us to

  1. Use `"type": "module"` in our `package.json`
  1. Output files with `.js` extensions
  1. Produce a `./cjs` directory in the build output that contains a thin `package.json`, which configures `"type": "commonjs"` explicitly, conceptually overriding the `"type": "module"` configuration of the actual package.json.

### Minor Changes

- 01e63c702: internalize @dopt/javascript's `zustand/vanilla` and `zustand/middleware` dependencies by changing how the package is built. zustand generates non-compatible CJS, which previously required workarounds if using @dopt/javascript in CJS. after this version, all consumed zustand code will be internalized within the @dopt/javascript bundle, ensuring that the library is CJS compatible.

### Minor Changes

- 9d4037411: @dopt/javascript-common's API client now supports specifying "uncommitted" and "latest" as tags for a flow version when calling `GET` or `POST` on the flow. This update to the API client is also wired through @dopt/javascript and @dopt/react so users can specify those flow tags when initializing the packages. READMEs are also updated for both packages.

### Patch Changes

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e18bb04b4: Add force? options to @dopt/react and @dopt/javascript SDKs. This introduces functionality keeping the SDKs in line with our APIs and clients. When `force: true` is passed into the `start` or `reset` functions from `useFlow` and `Flow` respectively, those intents will forcefully start the flow. This means that they will start the flow despite any targeting or entry conditions. Otherwise, the intents will only start the flow if those conditions are met.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- d6732a3b4: Both @dopt/react and @dopt/javascript SDKs have been updated with respect to how the `field` accessor function works on `Block` instances. After this change, if Dopt is loading or a field doesn't exist on a `Block` (i.e. you try to access a field you haven't created in app.dopt.com), Dopt will return `undefined`. If a field is present, then Dopt will return the value of the field which may be `null` if the field has a value of empty in app.dopt.com. Additionally, both SDKs no longer support the optional `defaultValue` parameter -- if you would like to specify a default for the returned value, you can use the nullish operator: `block.field<string>('title') ?? '(empty)'`. Finally, in this major change for @dopt/javascript, we remove the deprecated and unused version parameter for `dopt.flow('name', <version>)` which was deprecated in 2.x.x.

### Minor Changes

- 856005780: Exposes RichText as a top level field type. This additive change allows for RichText objects to be returned by the blocks API and to be consumed and surfaced via the Blocks client, and React and Javascript SDKs.

  - @dopt/javascript-common@2.0.1

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- bfb03f6c: Ensure that optimisticUpdates only trigger when blocks are active. This ensures that blocks don't artificially get marked as `entered: true` and `exited: true`. These state fields were newly introduced in 2.0.0. Additionally, update `@dopt/javascript` README.md to reflect changes to state management and subscribe in v2.0.0.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 76103615: fixing formatting

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 1d53d9a0: For `Block<T>` interface and class types, update to an optional `T = unknown` generic. This will allow consumers to reference `Block` without having to write out `Block<unknown>`. Also, update Dopt's getting-started-checklist example to reflect this change.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 60df5938: ## Deprecation of Group blocks

  The 2.0.0 release will be removing the Group blocks from Dopt. This includes access to the Group blocks in the canvas, APIs, and SDKs.

  **tl;dr** We thought the abstraction of the Group block would be useful, but we’ve found it can be hard to understand and doesn’t support the logic needed for many flows. We think the new functionality added in this release (e.g., named paths, back paths, Gate blocks, branching on user properties) strike a better balance between being explicit and composable. Below you will find a more detailed explanation of how these changes manifest in the SDK.

  ## `Block`

  ### Object changes

  We've migrated the `state()` function to be a `state` accessor (property). Instead of calling `block.state()`, you will now do `block.state`.

  ```diff
  - block.state()
  + block.state
  ```

  We've renamed the `completed` state to `exited`. Because blocks can now be accessed multiple times with cyclic paths, `exited` is more meaningful.

  ```diff
  - block.state.completed
  + block.state.exited
  ```

  We've renamed the `getField` function on the block instance to `field` to match our other accessors.

  ```diff
  - block.getField('field-name')
  + block.field('field-name')
  ```

  `block.subscribe(listener)` now calls your `listener` with the `block` instance rather than just a data representation. This means that you can now call the `field` accessor, use the `transition` function, and more, with the `subscribe` function.

  ```js
  block.subscribe((changed) => changed.field('field-name'));
  ```

  ### Transitions

  The block object representation has also changed to accommodate for edges in the flow having names (called transitions).

  To support transitions, we've removed the `complete` function on blocks and replaced it with a `transition` function that can be used to specify what path to traverse from this block. The new `transition` methods requires the name of the `transition` (the label on the edge) you are transitioning to. All pre-existing edges will be migrated to be named 'default';

  ```diff
  - block.complete();
  + block.transition('default');
  ```

  We’ve also added a `transitioned` object to the block that will track the state of those paths, e.g., if the user moves along an outgoing path `next` from a block named `A`, the `block.transitioned.next` on block `A` value would change from `false` to `true`.

  The properties of the transition object are a function of the paths in the flow you’ve designed in Dopt. To flexibly accommodate for that, the block is generic with respect to the transitions associated with it.

  ```ts
  const block = dopt.block<['edge-one', 'edge-two']>('edge-id');
  ```

  You can find examples of how to instantiate these blocks with generics at [app.dopt.com](https://app.dopt.com) when you select step blocks within a flow.

  ### Removed group methods

  The following methods were all associated with groups which are deprecated.

  - `block.next`
  - `block.prev`
  - `block.goTo`
  - `block.getCompleted`
  - `block.getUncompleted`
  - `block.getActive`
  - `block.getInactive`

  ## `Flow`

  ### Object changes

  We've migrated the `state()` function to be a `state` accessor (property). Instead of calling `flow.state()`, you will now do `flow.state`.

  ```diff
  - flow.state()
  + flow.state
  ```

  The flow `exited` state has been renamed to `stopped`. The flow `exit` function has been renamed to `stop`.

  ```diff
  - flow.state.exited
  + flow.state.stopped

  - flow.exit()
  + flow.stop()
  ```

  The flow `completed` state has been renamed to `finished`. The flow `complete` function has been renamed to `finish`.

  ```diff
  - flow.state.completed
  + flow.state.finished

  - flow.complete()
  + flow.finish()
  ```

  The `flow.blocks()` function now returns full, up-to-date block instances on which methods like `field` and `transition` can be called.

  ```js
  const blocks = flow.blocks();
  blocks.forEach((block) => block.field('field-name'));
  blocks.forEach((block) => block.transition('default'));
  ```

  `flow.subscribe(listener)` now calls your `listener` with the `flow` instance rather than just a data representation. This means that you can now call the `blocks` accessor, access intent functions, and more with the `subscribe` function.

  ```js
  flow.subscribe((changed) => changed.blocks());
  ```
