### Patch Changes

  - @dopt/core-rich-text@2.3.0

## 4.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 8bd8d1167: Our opensource packages previously produced build artifacts that were intended to to be friendly to various build and module systems by

  1. Using `"type": "commonjs"` in their `package.json` (the default and less modern configuration)
  1. Using file extensions to delineate between module systems (e.g. `mjs` for ESM and `cjs` for CJS)

  This strategy, while seemingly friendly more freindly than using `"type": "module"`, caused issue for older build tools that do not support these file extensions.

  This change moves all of our open source packages and their transitive `"dependencies"` to use `@dopt/pkg-build`, our newly created CLI for building packages in the most backward compatible way we can come up with.

  This strategy shifts us to

  1. Use `"type": "module"` in our `package.json`
  1. Output files with `.js` extensions
  1. Produce a `./cjs` directory in the build output that contains a thin `package.json`, which configures `"type": "commonjs"` explicitly, conceptually overriding the `"type": "module"` configuration of the actual package.json.

## 4.2.0

### Minor Changes

- cb25c6b04: Add optional force parameters to `/v2/flow/:id:/start` and `/v2/flow/:id/reset` endpoints. If this parameter is set to true in the querystring of the request, then then the flow will always be started despite any entry conditions for the flow. This allows developers to override and forcefully start a flow (or reset a flow) from the API. This change will also subsequently be included in the React and JS SDKs.
