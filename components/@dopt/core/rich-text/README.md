# @dopt/core-rich-text

This package contains Dopt's type definitions and schema for defining a rich text field's returned values (the field's abstract syntax tree). These type definitions are used in Dopt's SDKs, [@dopt/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dopt/react) and [@dopt/javascript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dopt/javascript), and in Dopt's rich-text renderer, [@dopt/react-rich-text](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dopt/react-rich-text).
