# @dopt/html-rich-text

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e8e8049bb: Changes style and class packaging patterns for @dopt/_-theme and @dopt/_-rich-text. First, all shared styles are moved into the @dopt/core-_ packages. Second, all shared styles are imported in the @dopt/react-_ packages and not re-imported in further downstream packages like @dopt/react-card, @dopt/react-tour, etc. Third, styles which are exposed are greatly simplified in tha t @dopt/react-_ packages no longer export their styles. If you'd like to see these styles, you can visit the @dopt/core-_ packages. Finally, some minor refactoring is done in @dopt/core-theme and @dopt/core-rich-text to enable a @dopt/html-rich-text renderer which takes Dopt's RichText object and produces an HTML string.
